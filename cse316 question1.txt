question1.A barbershop consists of a waiting room with n chairs and a barber room with one barber chair. If there are no customers
 to be served, the barber goes to sleep. If a customer enters the barbershop and all chairs are occupied, then the customer 
leaves the shop. If the barber is busy but chairs are available, then the customer sits in one of the free chairs. If the 
barber is asleep, the customer wakes up the barber. Write a program to coordinate the barber and the customers.

semaphore customer_1 = 0;
semaphore barbers_1 = 0;
semaphore cuttinghair_1 = 0;
semaphore mutex = 1;
int customers1 = 0;
void barber123() {
while(true) {
wait(customer_1); //sleep when there are no waiting customers
wait(mutex); //mutex for accessing customers1
customers1 = customers1 - 1;
signal(barbers_1);
signal(mutex);
cut_hair();
}
}
void customer() {
wait(mutex); //mutex for accessing customers1
if (customers1 < n) {
customers1 = customers1 + 1;
signal(customers);
signal(mutex);
wait(barbers_1); //wait for available barbers
get_haircut();
}
else { //do nothing (leave) when all chairs are used.
signal(mutex);
}
}
cut_hair(){
waiting(cuttinghair_1);
}
get_haircut(){
get hair cut for some time;
signal(cuttinghair_1);
}
